  ## Description
  This application logs information about employees on a software engineering team and generates a HTML website that displays an overview of the team. It operates on Node and uses Inquirer to recieve user input. Email-validator is used to validate email input. The application was created using object orientated code and TDD. Testing was performed using Jest.
  ## Instructions
  Clone down the repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Once this is complete, enter 'node index' in your terminal to launch the application. 
  ## Usage
  Each prompt has validation attached to it. Employee ID only accepts a numerical value. Each prompt must be answered to proceed. If an input is not necessary, remove the validate lines from the code in lib/Team.js. Once each prompt is answered, the generated HTML file can be found in the /dist folder. 
  
  ## Test Instructions
  Tests on this application are run using jest. To run these tests, enter 'npm run test' in the command line. Optionally you can specify the file you wish to run tests on by entering 'npm run test {fileName}'.
